Hello. I am Apivich Hemachandra, although I also go by the name of Kaotoo[^1].

I have recently been accepted to the School of Computing at National University of Singapore (NUS) as a graduate student. Since this is my first semester, I do not have a research advisor just yet. 

Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor's degree from Mahidol University International College (MUIC) in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand. I majored in Physics, however I also completed minors in Computer Science and Mathematics. My Bachelor's Thesis was related to <a href="/projects/thesis">data diversification</a>[^2].

I have also worked on different computer science-related projects with professors and researchers in Thailand. Some are research projects related to ML and algorithms, while some are projects I have done with large firms in Thailand. 

For more details you may check out <a href="/cv">my CV</a>.

### Personal Life

I was born in Bangkok, however was raised in Chiang Mai. I lived in Chiang Mai until I turned 18 when I completed my A-Levels, before moving to Bangkok to complete my undergraduate degree. 

When I am not busy doing work, I enjoy playing and listening to music. I am a mediocre drummer, guitarist and vocalist, and helped running music club back in high school. 

I enjoy watching football (or soccer as some may call it), and am a fan of Nottingham Forest (who will hopefully be in the Premier League soon). 

<a href="/youtube">I also make maths videos whenever I have enough free time</a>.

[^1]: _Apivich Hemachandra_ is my legal name, whereas _Kaotoo_ is my nickname. You can check out the Thai naming convention <a href="(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_name)">here</a>, but in brief, _Apivich Hemachandra_ is more for formal documents and events, whereas _Kaotoo_ is what people would usually refer to me as.

[^2]: I asked my physics program director nicely enough and he allowed me to do a thesis on a topic related to computer science.
