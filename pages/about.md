Hello. I am Apivich Hemachandra, although I also go by the name of Kaotoo.

I was born in Bangkok, but was raised in Chiang Mai for the first 18 years of my life. In Chiang Mai, I completed my A-Levels in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Biology.

I then continued my studies at Mahidol University International College, where I completed my undergraduate degree in Physics, with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics. During these four years, I made a lot of discoveries about myself, including the fact that I didn't want to pursue physics at higher levels, and that I was more interested in computer science. High school never really exposed me to computer science, but I'm glad that at least my university did.

By the time I decided I wanted to do computer science instead, I was in my third year, and have completed a majority of my physics credits needed. To compensate, I started taking more computer science classes than I needed to for my minor, and found research internships related to computer science.

At the moment I work on different computer science-related projects with several different people. Some are research projects on various different topics, while some are projects which are industry-oriented. Having done work with many different people for different purposes has allowed me to appreciate the beauty of computer science, and how applicable it is in the modern society.

I am currently on a year break from studying, although I hope to attend a graduate school in the near future (hopefully within the next year if someone accepts me).

When I am not busy doing work, I enjoy playing and listening to music. I am a mediocre drummer, guitarist and vocalist. I also enjoy watching football (or soccer as some may call it), and am a fan of Nottingham Forest (who will hopefully be in the Premier League soon).
