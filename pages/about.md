Hello. I am Apivich Hemachandra, although I also go by the name of Kaotoo.

I was born in Bangkok, but was raised in Chiang Mai for the first 18 years of my life. In Chiang Mai, I completed my A-Levels in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Biology.

I then continued my studies at Mahidol University International College, where I completed my undergraduate degree in Physics, with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics. During these four years, I made a lot of discoveries about myself, including the fact that I didn't want to pursue physics at higher levels, and that I was more interested in computer science. High school never really exposed me to computer science, but as I took more classes in CS at university, it felt closer to what I was interested in working on.

By the time I decided I wanted to do computer science instead however, I was in my third year of university, and have completed a majority of my physics credits needed. To compensate, I started taking extra computer science classes, and found internships related to computer science.

I have worked on different computer science-related projects with different groups of people. Some are research projects related to ML or algorithms, while some are projects which are industry-oriented (often requiring knowledge from operations research). Having done work with many different people for different purposes has allowed me to appreciate the beauty of computer science, and how applicable it is in the modern society.

I am currently on a year break from studying, working part-time as a data analyst (to feed myself) while also doing other research work in my spare time (since it is very enjoyable). I plan to attend graduate school in the near future, hopefully when COVID-19 isn't as much of a disruption to daily lives anymore.

When I am not busy doing work, I enjoy playing and listening to music. I am a mediocre drummer, guitarist and vocalist. I also enjoy watching football (or soccer as some may call it), and am a fan of Nottingham Forest (who will hopefully be in the Premier League soon).
