# Industry-Related Projects

I, with a few others, are working on projects with PTTEP, a Thai company who deals with extraction of petroleum. The projects I work on involves automation of tasks currently done by human, and will often require skills and knowledge from machine learning, statistics, mathematics and even physics.
