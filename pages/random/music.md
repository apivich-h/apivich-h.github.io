I don't claim to be a massive music nerd or anything, but I do like listening to something to fill the empty void. I listen to tracks from very few bands, and I don't really know why. I guess there's something about familiarity that is comforting, so I tend to just not explore too much musically.

Anyway, the following are some playlists that I keep.

## Earworms

These are the songs that I, at some point in my life, played on repeat _way_ too many times. This is roughly in order of when it was stuck in my head.

        allowtransparency="true"
        allow="encrypted-media"
        webkitallowfullscreen
        mozallowfullscreen
        allowfullscreen>
