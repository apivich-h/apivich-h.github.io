They mostly are just minor yet interesting trivia, or some mistake I learnt about. I will also sort them all by the date I found out about it. Maybe you'll learn something too (or maybe not if you know everything I listed out here).

- `2020-12-22` - You can place 32 knights on a chessboard without any of them attacking each other. It's quite an obvious fact after a bit of thought, but also a very neat argument to show the fact (proof can be written in a line). It has been taken from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV2e2aokU-0">this clip from QI</a>.

- `2020-11-28` - Only humans and armadillos can catch leprosy. I found this while randomly watching Taskmaster (10 points if you know which episode).

- `2020-08-05` - That one of the algorithms that can be used for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">fast Fourier Transform</a> is just a divide-and-conquer algorithm. I always thought it was something more complicated (since the actual Fourier Transform is just a whole bunch of integration).

- `2020-07-29` - The transition from one scene in a video to another scene in a video or some music piece is actually called a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/segue">segue</a>, not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segway">Segway</a> (I learnt this from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVDQEoe6ZWY">this unrelated video</a>).
