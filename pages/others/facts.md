I keep a random list of things I learnt. They mostly are just minor yet interesting trivia, or some mistake I learnt about. I will also sort them all by the date I found out about it. Maybe you'll learn something too (or maybe not if you know everything I listed out here).

- `2020-07-29` - The transition from one scene in a video to another scene in a video or some music piece is actually called a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/segue">segue</a>, not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segway">Segway</a> (I learnt this from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVDQEoe6ZWY">this unrelated video</a>).
