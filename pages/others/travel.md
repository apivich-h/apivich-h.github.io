Yeah, I don't go travelling too often. My last big trips were both in 2018, when I went to England for a week (where I visited Cheltenham and London), and when I spent four months in the United States (mainly stayed in Madison but also spent a few days in Chicago).

I'm not a person who likes to take a lot of photos, so here are some vlogs of those trips.

- For my trip to England, check both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpz-YYi6sAI">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOmm47_aglA">Part 2</a>.

I have also been to a couple of other places within Asia, including

- A short trip to Japan, where I only stayed in Tokyo,

- Short trips to Malaysia and Cambodia, both for debating competitions, and

- A few days in Laos with my family.
