The following is a collection of classes I have taken during my undergraduate studies. Due to bureaucratic reasons, new courses cannot be easily added for students to take. As a result, lecturers will often offer classes whose content does not match the course name to getting around adding a new class into the system. For these courses, I have listed the course names as stated in my transcript along with its unofficial name and course content.
