I have two YouTube channels.

# RandomMathsInc

RandomMathsInc is a channel where I post educational (and entertaining) videos about topics related to maths. Here, the word "maths" is used very loosely, and often my videos end up being about things in physics or computer science. As of January 2022, the channel has around 8.4k subscribers.

I often describe my videos as anti-3Blue1Brown, since 3B1B does their illustrations on Manim (which is all nice and professional), whereas I tend to do my drawings on Paint or on paper (which is not all nice and professional).

I try to post videos on there when I have an idea and I have the time to execute those ideas. Unfortunately, I often have the ideas but usually not enough time for the videos. My upload schedule is therefore very inconsistent (_sad emoji_).

If you just want to check out the highlights, I recommend the following.
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aQV1iJiZwA">The video where I made a solver for the game Flows</a>. This is probably my favourite video, since it showcased a great maths project I did while also going on a 40-minute tangent talking about linear programming and its applications in similar optimisation problems.
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2AVF3_qdHY">The video where I made a solver for the game Wordle</a>. Another game solver video, but this time involving framing the Wordle game as a problem in statistics, and using basic probability theory to solve and analyse the game.
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNkrqdN1tJs">The video on The Second Law of Thermodynamics</a>. It is a different kind of video in that it is more lecture-like, but I still decided to make a video about it since it is one of the most interesting way I have seen the law being explained.
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l27xKSNad2Y">The video on the Gaussian Integral</a>, which is my currently most-viewed video. Somehow enough people thought a low-quality video animated on MS Paint is worth a watch.
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6gJ2T0NSwM">The video on the Monte Carlo method</a>.
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxcPhAIFEU8">The video on the RSA Algorithm</a>, which was made when I was a lot younger.
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl0KpMljxsU">Half-Life</a>, a physics parody of Blur's Parklife (which is blocked in some countries).

I can't list out all of my videos on here, so if you think this channel has something that might be up your alley, I recommend you go check out the channel, or at least <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBzCYlA4J3e5KD8Xb_9AoOHFDs5vVkdWI">a playlist of my favourite videos on there</a>.

# RMI The Second

_<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTwdd4u7a301TWVMOVGXk-g">Click here to go to RMI The Second on Youtube.</a>_

Initially, this channel was simply going to be the second channel to RandomMathsInc (hence the name), where I just post extra information that I cannot fit into a video I post on RandomMathsInc.

However, over time, I just start posting other random stuff on there (including random vlogs of when I go places or just me rambling on about different topics). It therefore has ended up as a channel where I post videos that I feel doesn't belong on RandomMathsInc.
