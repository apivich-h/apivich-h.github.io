# Welcome!

This site is my corner of the internet, where I post things about myself and my random thoughts. To keep everything in a nice, orderly fashion, I have categorised this site into different sections, navigable from the tab above.

To know more about me, you can check the <a href="/about">About section</a>. If you are my potential employer, you can also check <a href="/cv">my CV</a> for more details about my professional accomplishments. I have also compiled past works that I have done on <a href="/projects">the projects page</a>, and I will be updating the page as I complete more projects.

I also keep <a href="/blog">a blog</a> where I will post random things I want to share to the world. They might be academic, and sometimes just be things that is up in my mind. The blog mostly serves as an excuse for me to write more. If you are not a fan of reading, you can also check out YouTube channels I have <a href="/youtube">here</a>.

If you want to contact me, you can do so by e-mail. _Please do not send me spams_.
