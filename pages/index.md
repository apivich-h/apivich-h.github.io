## About Myself

{% include image.html url="/images/profile.jpg" caption="Me lying on the road for no reason <br> (10 points if you know where this is)" width="300px" align="right" %}

Hello. I am Apivich Hemachandra (in Thai: อภิวิชญ์ ​เหมะจันทร), although I also go by my nickname[^1] "Kaotoo" (in Thai: ข้าวตู).

I am a fourth-year PhD student at the School of Computing at National University of Singapore (NUS), under the supervision of <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ngsk/">See-Kiong Ng</a> and <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkh/">Bryan Low Kian Hsiang</a>. I am currently working on (1) **data-efficient physics-informed machine learning**, and (2) **improving efficiency of multi-GPU training of large models** using ML techniques. If either of these topics interest you, feel free to reach out for a discussion!

Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor's degree from Mahidol University International College (MUIC) in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand. I majored in Physics, however I also completed minors in Computer Science and Mathematics. My Bachelor's Thesis was related to <a href="/projects/thesis-u">data diversification and submodular maximisation</a>[^2]. I have also worked on different computer science-related projects with researchers in Thailand and in collaboration with large local firms.

## Personal Life

<!-- <details>  -->
<!-- <summary><small>(Click to expand)</small></summary> -->
<!-- <br/> -->
I was born in Bangkok, however was raised in Chiang Mai. I lived in Chiang Mai until I turned 18 when I completed my high school, before moving to Bangkok/Nakhon Pathom to complete my undergraduate degree.
<!-- <br/><br/> -->

When I am not busy doing work, I enjoy playing and listening to music. I am a mediocre drummer, bassist and vocalist, and have been playing varying amounts of music since high school.
<!-- <br/><br/> -->

I enjoy watching football (or soccer as some may call it), and am a fan of Nottingham Forest (who <s>will hopefully be</s> <i>are now</i> in the Premier League <s>soon</s>).
<!-- <br/><br/> -->

<a href="/youtube">I also make maths videos whenever I have enough free time</a>.

[^1]: _Apivich Hemachandra_ is my legal name, whereas _Kaotoo_ is my nickname (and not really legally recognised). You can check out the Thai naming convention <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_name">here</a>, but in brief, _Apivich Hemachandra_ is for formal documents and more formal events, whereas _Kaotoo_ is what people would usually refer to me as in more casual settings. Both names were given to me by my parents at birth.

[^2]: I asked my physics department nicely enough and he allowed me to do a thesis on a topic related to computer science.
