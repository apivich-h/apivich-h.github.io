## About Myself

{% include image.html url="/images/profile.jpg" caption="Me lying on the road for no reason <br> (10 points if you know where this is)" width="300px" align="right" %}

Hello. I am Apivich Hemachandra, although I also go by the name of Kaotoo[^1].

I am a second-year PhD student at the School of Computing at National University of Singapore (NUS), under the supervision of <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkh/">Bryan Low Kian Hsiang</a>. I am currently working on topics related to neural active learning. 

Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor's degree from Mahidol University International College (MUIC) in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand. I majored in Physics, however I also completed minors in Computer Science and Mathematics. My Bachelor's Thesis was related to <a href="/projects/thesis-u">data diversification and submodular maximisation</a>[^2]. I have also worked on different computer science-related projects with professors and researchers in Thailand. Some are research projects related to ML and algorithms, while some are projects I have done with large firms in Thailand.

## Personal Life

<details> 
<summary><small>(Click to expand)</small></summary>
<br/>
I was born in Bangkok, however was raised in Chiang Mai. I lived in Chiang Mai until I turned 18 when I completed my A-Levels, before moving to Bangkok to complete my undergraduate degree.
<br/><br/>
When I am not busy doing work, I enjoy playing and listening to music. I am a mediocre drummer, guitarist and vocalist, and have been playing varying amounts of music since high school.
<br/><br/>
I enjoy watching football (or soccer as some may call it), and am a fan of Nottingham Forest (who <s>will hopefully be</s> <i>are now</i> in the Premier League <s>soon</s>).
<br/><br/>
<a href="/youtube">I also make maths videos whenever I have enough free time</a>.

[^1]: _Apivich Hemachandra_ is my legal name, whereas _Kaotoo_ is my nickname. You can check out the Thai naming convention <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_name">here</a>, but in brief, _Apivich Hemachandra_ is for formal documents and more formal events, whereas _Kaotoo_ is what people would usually refer to me as in more casual settings. Both names were given to me by my parents at birth.

[^2]: I asked my physics program director nicely enough and he allowed me to do a thesis on a topic related to computer science.
