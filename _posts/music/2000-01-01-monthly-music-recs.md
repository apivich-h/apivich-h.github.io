Hi. Welcome to the page Monthly Music Recommendations (MMR), where I recommend a song I got obsessed with during the month, all listed in reverse chronological order. I'll also add a few lines about the song (and possibly the artist themselves) as well just to make it a nice read. A few rules about the MMR:

1. It must be a song I really liked from that particular month. This may mean I discovered it in that month, or having some heavy rotations during the month.

2. After featuring a song from a certain artist, I can't feature another of their song for another ~~12 months~~ 6 months. Out of all the rules this will be the one that I will enforce on myself as a hard constraint. ~~The 12 months is an arbitrary number which might change at some point, but will try to at least make it a point to not repeat artists unless I really like their song in that month.~~ Ended up shortening this period because 12 months is a bit too long that I may already get back on a cycle to really listening to someone again. And life is too short for such constraints anyway.

3. A softer rule related to the one previous -- I will (try to) not feature songs from artists that were picked as my latest AOTY (see [here](/posts/music/aoty)), and discourage ones that were AOTY at some point before as well.

4. I will prioritise songs that were released more recently. Ultimately I will still prefer songs I like, but may give some bias towards more recent songs a bit more.

## May 2025 - _A Lot's Gonna Change_ by Weyes Blood

Not much to say but the fact that the entirety of _Titanic Rising_ is an incredible one, and one that I feel gives a really good vibe to what her style is about. I find her like a less rock version of The Last Dinner Party, and I don't know what exactly draws me to this genre so much. Maybe it's the diversion from the modern pop, or maybe it's just the want for some older ounds with a new spin.

The opener _A Lot's Gonna Change_ is a meaningful track about growing up and trying to cope with that. And I find this quite a relatable track in a lot of ways. Not to mention that it's also a banger.

Other shoutouts:

- _Passionate Goodbye_ by Psy. For reasons I cannot say, I have been getting into Psy lately even if about ten years too late. Outside of _Gangnam Style_, it turns out he has some other bangers also.

- _Lazarus_ by Porcupine Tree. An older one but popped up on my playlist again recently.

## April 2025 - _Close to You_ by Gracie Abrams

First off, going to give a shoutout to _Forever Howlong_ by Black Country, New Road which is a new album released this month. It's my AoTY so far this year, but alas, I have already shouted out _Bestie_ earlier in the year, so I'm gonna go for the artist I got quite hyped about this month.

But anyway, Gracie Abrams. She's a bit of a controversial singer for a number of reasons. I personally don't think her music is bad, and if anything I find her latest album an alright pop album. It might not have been AoTY material but it's definitely a relaxing listen and quite fun at points.

Other shoutouts:

- _Ankles_ by Lucy Dacus. Her album is, in complete honesty, a bit flat compared to some of her previous works, but still a good work nonetheless. _Ankles_ was the lead single, and seems like an easy pick, but it really is my favourite track from the album.

## March 2025 - _Real Life_ by The Marias

Other shoutouts:

- _John L_ by black midi.

- _Lovesick_ by Alice Phoebe Lou.

- _Everything is Embarassing_ by Sky Ferreira.

- _สัญญาหน้าฝน_ by Carabao.

- ~~_A Lot's Gonna Change_ by Weyes Blood.~~

- _How Bad Do U Want Me_ by Lady Gaga.

## February 2025 - _Besties_ by Black Country, New Road

I heard this song on the last few days of January but it has grown on me quite a bit throughout this month, and it's already one of my favourite new releases from this year I've heard so far. Yes it's quite different from their first two albums, but so what? It's still a a very fun song even if it's a bit more "polished" than their other stuff. The vibe is a lot happier especially compared to Ants From Up There, but I can still see the grand sounds and the bands just enjoying themselves all the same. Really looking forward to their album after hearing this single.

Other shoutouts:

- _Some Type of Skin_ by Aurora. Saw her live this month, and it was phenomenal.

- _Flea_ by St Vincent. I can see why she won a Grammy this year.

- ~~_Real Life_ by The Marias.~~

- _Tick Tock_ by Tom Misch.

- _I Only Said_ by My Bloody Valentine.

- _Here's Where The Story Ends_ by The Sundays.

Quite a diverse list of songs I discovered this week. Here's to more months of music discovery this year.

## January 2025 - _Belinda Says_ by Alvvays

I have been listening to _Blue Rev_ a lot in January. It's definitely an album that has grown on me since I first listened to it. The album is just so tight instrumentally, and _Belinda Says_ itself is just such a burst of emotions. The guitar effects, the little key shift towards the end, the emotions from the vocals all blend together incredibly well. It has not been that long since I last had Alvvays on this list, but yeah, I have really been into the song this month so that has got to be my pick.

Other shoutouts:

- _Holy, Holy_ by Geordie Greep. Okay yeah, I haven't really gotten into much Black Midi. But after listening to enough BCNR and hearing about them online, I gave their music a go. It's a really chaotic sound, but somehow it really hits you melodically in an interesting way. Geordie's work is no different. The instrumentation is incredible with this one. The guy's melodies are so catchy, I can still hear the brass from _Holy, Holy_ in my head. The lyrics are a bit questionable but yeah, it's definitely a fun song.

- _Pulldrone_ by Ethel Cain. I didn't expect to like the album so much, but something about its eerieness gets to me. The vibes makes it an uncomfortable listen, but in a good way. I didn't expect her to depart so much from her debut album (even if that's already quite off the mainstream sounds), but it's still quite an interesting listen.

- _Drone:Nodrone_ by The Cure. Now this one I slept on. So many people highly rated this album in their year end lists, but I didn't think much of it until I really gave it a listen. Wow. This was _not_ what I was expecting from The Cure, based on the hits I have heard. I should really listen to their discography a bit more now.

- ~~_Besties_ by Black Country, New Road~~

## December 2024 - _Image_ by Magdalena Bay

This has got to be up there as one of best albums in 2024, and definitely an album I discovered too late into the year.

I have seen many people naming _Imaginal Disk_ as their AOTY in 2024 and I can totally see why this would be the case. It's an incredibly well written electropop album and I have gone back to it again and again even in the short time I have heard of it. The instrumentation itself is very fun and has a lot of things you can pick up on even in the subsequent listens. _Image_ in particular is one of my favourites from the album -- from the slight change of tempo at the intro, to the catchy chorus, and the sounds that makes you feel like zooming along some futuristic cityscape. It's an amazing record overall, and I am so glad (yet a bit sad) I only caught it even so late on.

Other shoutouts:

- _Thank You_ by Clairo. I heard this song again this month at a clothing store, but the album itself has already been one that I enjoyed from the year. It's another album that I have been enjoying more towards the tail end of the year, and really demonstrates that Clairo can write anything and it'll be great.

- _Cardinal_ by Kacey Musgraves. I have heard of her for a while now but only have checked out her music. Her soft voice is great though and it's a great folk vibe.

- _Alley Rose_ by Conan Gray. An artist that I could have seen in Jakarta but I skipped on. His album is great, but _Alley Rose_ is a great one to belt out while in the shower. Trust me on that one.

It's a bit of a theme this month where all the songs are from 2024 albums that I haven't been so obsessed with throughout the year.

## November 2024 - _Fox Cub / Apocalypse / Special / The Zookeeper's Boy_ by Mew

Yes, I picked four songs. Fight me.

I have been listening to some Mew recently (they have some pure vibes tracks which is great), and once again it stems from checking out artists that Birdy covered in her debut album (see The National from a few months ago). In particular, _And The Glass Handed Kites_ is an interesting album. It has a good alt rock sound to it, with great instrumentation.
The album also has a nice bit of transitioning going on between the four pieces. In a listen, it almost feels like different pieces of a single long song. It feels hard to separate them, so I'm just gonna feature all of them.

Other shoutouts:

- _Everything In Its Right Place_ by Radiohead. This is mainly because I saw Thom Yorke live earlier in the month. It was him alone, but was still incredible show nonetheless.

- _ฟ้า_ by Tattoo Colour.

- _Unclear_ by Kodaline. Back with another usual artist.

## October 2024 - _obsessed_ by Olivia Rodrigo

I'm so obsessed with your tracks (balalalalala).

Could you tell I was at the GUTS tour earlier? I went to the show being familiar with a good amount of her two albums, but I really didnt expect the show to be so good.

Other shoutouts:

- _feelslikeimfallinginlove_ by Coldplay. For the past two Coldplay albums I have done this thing where I avoid all promo and singles until the album release date (was very tough too especially with all of my fellow Coldlplay enthusiasts around). And oh boy, the album was definitely worth that wait.

- _Come Fly With Me_ by Norah Jones.

- _Comforting Sounds_ by Mew.

- _Gagarin_ by Public Service Broadcast.

## September 2024 - _Lifelong Song_ by Men I Trust

Random pick, but Men I Trust really does slap. I have been checking out tracks with these vibes a bit more, and it's quite a fun and chill listen really. _Lifelong Song_ is a shoutout for me, mainly because of _the lick_. If you know, you know.

Other shoutouts:

- _While You Were Sleeping_ by Laufey. I am so tempted to put this as the recommendation this month since I have been putting her music on heavy repeat since I went to see her live. But I am going to refrain myself a bit. _While You Were Sleeping_ is the song that Laufey have been opening her shows with, and it really does bring a new energy to the song now that I hear it on tape. Now that I have you guys here though, [she recently covered Phoebe Bridger's _Savior Complex_](https://youtu.be/_v_cwLmeuY4) and it is the best cover I have heard this month.

- _recently_ by Liana Flores. Spotify music recommendation really doing its thing again with this one. Soft acoustic song that I was introduced to this month.

- _I Love You, I'm Sorry_ by Gracie Abrams. I am surprised that I enjoy her music. I don't think it will be in my top albums this year, but it's definitely one where I'll put on now and then, and I'm not sure why.

- _Ptolemaea_ by Ethel Cain. I don't want to say too much about the song except for that it's incredible (and that there's one particular bit in the track that hits very hard). However I do recommend you all to check the whole album out rather than just the one song -- it is incredible haunting but definitely worth a listen.

## August 2024 - _Steamroller_ by Phoebe Bridgers

After listening to her for a few years at this point, I am finally beginning my entrance into the Phoebe Bridgers rabbit hole. There are a few old Phoebe Bridgers performances online where she performs some of the older (sometimes unreleased) songs. And boy, all of them are _sad_. A few worth mentioning are Waiting Room, Georgia (in particular my favourite version that was more rock than the album version), and Steamroller. The latter is not even on Spotify (it originally was but it was sadly removed) so you'll have to go listen to it from other unofficial sources. But one thing that Steamroller (and to be honest her other early tracks) had very heartfelt and somewhat direct lyrics. She just puts all her emotions into words, and I kind of respect that.

Other shoutouts:

- _Promise_ by Laufey. Less than a year ago I featured a different track of hers, _Lovesick_, from the same album _Bewitched_, so I am only putting this track as an honourable mention. _Lovesick_ was the the song about someone falling in love, and dreaming of what it all could be. _Promise_, on the other hand, is sort of the opposite. It's probably one of the saddest Laufey songs out there (I might even say it is the saddest). What do I like about the song? Is it the beautifully crafted lyrics of hers? Is it her angelic voice? Is it just how soft and gentle the instrumentation is to fit around the track? I don't know, but y'all should give it a listen.

- _Voyager_ by Birdy. I have already featured her album _Young Heart_ as my AOTY in 2022, and I still have the album on repeat. The reason I wanted to feature the song here is because I went to a Birdy concert earlier in the month, and it was a great experience. _Voyager_ is already one of my favourite track of here, and so I am very glad I got to hear the track played live (among her other tracks obviously). Since then I have been having more Birdy songs on repeat again.

## July 2024 - _Femininomenon_ by Chappell Roan

I bought into the hype.

Chappell is incredible. Sure, maybe Spotify did try to push her to all of the listeners. But dammit she deserves it. The whole album is incredible, and a strong contender for one of my AOTY spots this year. Chappell's songs are a bop -- point to any of them and you can find something good about it. The lyrics, the bridge, every song is just unique and so, so good.

But, being a fan of good album openers, _Femininomenon_ is my favourite for being such a strong one. From the slower buildup, to the bridge, and even the short talking bit to hype the listeners a bit. It has a catchy hook and a real fun one to just sing along to. I can really see why Chappell is such an icon.

I have been away for a bit, so I really don't have any other good shoutouts this month. Just go listen to more Chappell Roan if you haven't already.

## June 2024 - _Nothing Matters_ by The Last Dinner Party

At last, I feel I have caught up with the pop music of 2024.

I have been listening to more music released in 2024, and a few albums have been quite good. The girl in red album, the Clairo album, the Faye Webster album, the Charli XCX record, etc. But The Last Dinner Party is just some really fresh rock sound from a newer band. And it's good. I don't know what about them, but it gives some very renaissance-y vibe that I enjoy. The whole album is great though (_Feminine Urge_ and _Sinner_ being some of the other tracks I enjoy), and you all should give it a listen.

Other shoutouts:

- _You Need Me Now?_ by girl in red featuring Sabrina Carpenter.

- the _girl, so confusing_ version with lorde, by Charli XCX.

- _But Not Kiss_ by Faye Webster.

- ~~_Femininomenon_ by Chappell Roan~~

These are pretty much some of the 2024 albums that I enjoyed thus far.

## May 2024 - _Terrible Love_ by The National

Definitely walking with spiders for this one.

I have heard the Birdy cover of this song for a while now (which is also incredible), but the original version is just something else. In fact, the whole album _High Violet_ is a great listen. Surprised it took me so long to go through the album. Nay -- I'm surprised I have not been as into The National as I should have been. Their discography has such a good vibe, and I'm a bit sad I haven't been listening to them earlier.

Other shoutouts:

- _Supercut_ by Lorde.

- _Perth_ by Bon Iver.

---

## April 2024 - _Sad To Breathe_ by The Japanese House

This is an album that was released in 2023, but I suppose it's not too late to discover it. I have been a bit into the indie music, and The Japanese House has been an obsession this month. I think the whole album is quite good. I can't really point to what I like about the song, but something just feels right. Maybe it's the lyrics, maybe it's the slight change of tempo in the song. But regardless, it's my pick this month.

Other shoutouts:

- _Run Away With Me_ by Carly Rae Jepsen.

---

## March 2024 - _Adult Diversion_ by Alvvays

This one is an interesting one for me.

The album sort of comes out of nowhere, one of those I got recommended by my Spotify. I'm quite glad tho, really do find the album a fun listen. I did pick the opening track (I have something for strong openers of albums), but other songs like _Archie, Marry Me_ or _The Agency Group_ are also some strong singles from the band. Maybe shoegaze will become a thing for me this year.

Other shoutouts:

- _Anywhere_ by Passenger.

- _Queen of Peace_ by Florence + The Machine.

- _brutal_ by Olivia Rodrigo.

I also realise that it's been three months, and I haven't really came across much new music that really wows me yet. Hmmm, maybe I need to pay attention to the new releases a bit more.

## February 2024 - _Autobahn_ by Kraftwerk

\*Car engine starts.\* _Au-to-bahn. Au-to-bahn. Au-to-bahn. Au-to-bahn..._

I didn't expect an 70s electronic band from Germany to be on this list at the start of the year. I'm especially not someone who listens to electronic much, but something about Kraftwerk is just different. For a 70s album, they definitely do not sound aged. It's a 20 minute long track, but it really does build the atmosphere well. Highly recommended.

Other shoutouts:

- _Burning Down The House_, a Talking Heads cover by Paramore.

- _สนิทใจ_ by Palmy.

- _The Family Madrigal_ by Stephanie Beatriz (from _Encanto_ soundtrack).

---

## January 2024 - _Lovesick_ by Laufey

I am so sad I discovered her music so late into 2023 (pretty much the last month of 2023). But I am making it up for it in 2024.

I don't really listen to anything remotely jazz. It is not that Laufey is necessarily jazz (frankly her style of music wouldn't be the first thing I think of when someone says jazz), but I do also think that she is able to really combine some interesting jazz elements into more modern pop music. And I do find that a good change from the other songs that I do listen to. Not to mention that she's an amazing vocalist as well, probably one of the best in the modern days.

The whole album _Bewitched_ is a great one, but _Lovesick_ hits me especially. The song lyrics would fit with most other love songs from normal pop music, but the music that accompanies it is more unusual compared to other pop music. Not to mention that Laufey's voice is absolutely incredible.

Other shoutouts:

- _Athens, France_ by Black Country, New Road. Aside from the fact that the band doesn't really get geography, the track itself is a masterpiece instrumentally and also lyrically.

- _Surfin' Bird_ by The Trashmen. Yes, it was because of Family Guy.

---

## December 2023 - _Knees Deep_ by The Beths

Opening the list strong with this one. This is the reason I had to start the MMR on my blog.

The Beths are a New Zealand-based pop rock/indie band, and I don't even remember how I came across them in the first place, but I recently went to a record store and saw their debut album _Future Me Hates Me_ on vinyl on a discount. I remembered listening to their latest album and the song _Expert In A Dying Field_ and really liking it, so I naturally bought the LP.

And god it was incredible. I listened to the LP before, but listening to it again was incredible. The songs on it were great, with _Little Death_ and _Happy Unhappy_ being the two that stood out in particular. The two having similar themes of being about some feeling that you get after liking someone. These along with the rest of the tracks make for a very strong introduction to The Beths for me.

However, through their discography, I found _Knees Deep_ to be the song that I come back to the most. The song started with an upbeat guitar riff, and an extremely catchy and happy-sounding hook. Once again, the song itself does not disappoint. The song also has an accompanying music video which genuinely puts a smile on my face (especially seeing each of the band members bungee-jumping one by one).
