Hi. Welcome to the page where I recommend a song I got obsessed with during the month, all listed in reverse chronological order. I'll also add a few lines about the song (and possibly the artist themselves) as well just to make it a nice read. A few rules about it:

1. It must be a song I really liked from that particular month. This may mean I discovered it in that month, or having some heavy rotations during the month.

2. After featuring a song from a certain artist, I can't feature another of their song for another 12 months. Out of all the rules this will be the one that I will enforce on myself as a hard constraint. The 12 months is an arbitrary number which might change at some point, but will try to at least make it a point to not repeat artists unless I _really_ like their song in that month.

3. A softer rule related to the one previous -- I will (try to) not feature songs from artists that were picked as my latest AOTY (see [here](/posts/music/aoty)), and discourage ones that were AOTY at some point before as well.

4. I will prioritise songs that were released that month. Ultimately I will still prefer songs I like, but may give some bias towards more recent songs a bit more.

## January 2024 - _Lovesick_ by Laufey

I am so sad I discovered her music so late into 2023 (pretty much the last month of 2023). But I am making it up for it in 2024.

I don't really listen to anything remotely jazz. It is not that Laufey is necessarily jazz, but I do also think that she is able to really combine some interesting jazz elements into more modern pop music. And I do find that a good change from the other songs that I do listen to.

The whole album _Bewitched_ is a great one, but _Lovesick_ hits me especially. The song lyrics would fit with most other love songs from normal pop music, but the music that accompanies it is more unusual compared to other pop music. Not to mention that Laufey's voice is absolutely incredible.

## December 2023 - _Knees Deep_ by The Beths

Opening the list strong with this one. This is the reason I had to start this list on my blog.

The Beths are a New Zealand-based pop rock/indie band, and I don't even remember how I came across them in the first place, but I recently went to a record store and saw their debut album _Future Me Hates Me_ on vinyl on a discount. I remembered listening to their latest album and the song _Expert In A Dying Field_ and really liking it, so I naturally bought the LP.

And god it was incredible. I listened to the LP before, but listening to it again was incredible. The songs on it were great, with _Little Death_ and _Happy Unhappy_ being the two that stood out in particular. The two having similar themes of being about some feeling that you get after liking someone. These along with the rest of the tracks make for a very strong introduction to The Beths for me.

However, through their discography, I found _Knees Deep_ to be the song that I come back to the most. The song started with an upbeat guitar riff, and an extremely catchy and happy-sounding hook. Once again, the song itself does not dissapoint. The song also has an accompanying music video which genuinely puts a smile on my face (especially seeing each of the band members bungee-jumping one by one).
