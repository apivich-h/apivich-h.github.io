title: Some Playlists I Have

I don't claim to be a massive music nerd or anything, but I do like listening to something to fill the empty void. I listen to tracks from very few bands, and I don't really know why. I guess there's something about familiarity that is comforting, so I tend to just not explore too much musically.

So here you go - two playlists with songs I like. Have fun analysing my music taste.

## Earworms

These are the songs that I, at some point in my life, played on repeat _way_ too many times.

        width="100%"
        height="480"
        frameborder="2"
        allowtransparency="true"
        allow="encrypted-media"
        webkitallowfullscreen
        mozallowfullscreen
        allowfullscreen>

</div>

## Favourites

This is just a list of random songs I enjoy listening to. Essentially a longer version of the playlist above.
