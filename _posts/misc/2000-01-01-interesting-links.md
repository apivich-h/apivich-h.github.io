# The Wild, Wild Internet -->

I browse the internet a lot, and I often find many amusing things on there. On this page, I keep a collection of them all, so you guys can also have a look. I will put the things here into a couple of categories.

## YouTube Channels

Here are a mix of YouTubers that I enjoy watching. Some are educational, some are more entertainment, and some are a mix of both. I tried to only list out the ones that I feel doesn't have enough subscribers, otherwise this list would go on for a bit too long. The list is in alphabetical order.

- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnFmWQbVW_YbqPQZGNuq8sA">Andrew Dotson</a>, a physics graduate student who posts all things physics (even memes)
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/muffinman3000">Daniel Thrasher</a>, a musician who mostly makes music skits
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DoctorBenjyFM">DoctorBenjy FM</a>, a stream most known for playing Football Manager and creating very interesting storylines for his saves
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/spencerbets">Hashtag United</a>, a non-league football team who posts all their progress on YouTube
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi9SqUCnW_flgsrl6_PRJFQ">HITC Sevens</a>, a football channel with unique football stories from a more historical/political/??? aspect
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJLZe_NoiG0hT7QCX_9vmqw">I Did A Thing</a>, an Australian YouTuber who makes cool things whilst narrating the process with a very monotone voice
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jacksfilms">Jacksfilms</a>, an unemployed YouTuber who makes skits on the internet
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jonbois">Jon Bois</a>, who creates very nice visual illustrations involving statistics from different sports (some of his other contents are on the SB Nation channel though)
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/standupmaths">Stand-up Maths (aka Matt Parker)</a>, a maths educator
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGYYNGmyhZ_kwBF_lqqXdAQ">Tifo Football</a>, a football-related channel who has a very unique way of presenting their data
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/enyay">Tom Scott</a>, a YouTuber who does a bit of everything (from videos on Things You Might Not Know to him and his friends doing funny panel shows based on Wikipedia articles)
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcf4LQogGFtYzPhq05uHE4g">udiprod</a>, a Youtube who does nice animations on physics and computer science
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfMJ2MchTSW2kWaT0kK94Yw">William Osman</a>, an engineer who also makes cool things online

I also keep another list specifically for YouTube videos.

## Subreddits

I enjoy browsing Reddit a lot, and I have subscribed to many subreddits. Many of them are hobby-based (e.g. subreddits for a particular sports team, TV show or musical band), but many of them just have random contents on them. If you look up something you enjoy, you will probably find a subreddit for it.

Below, I compile just a couple of subreddits that I like. You might find them interesting too.

- `r/AVoid5`, a location in which posts must avoid words containing fifthglyphs
- `r/badUIbattles` where people try their best to create things with bad user interfaces
- `r/cheeseburgers` which is a collection of photos of the best food mankind has ever invented
- `r/CozyPlaces` where people post photos of very cozy places
- `r/datasets` which contains different datasets for different purposes
- `r/DiWHY` which shows that not every DIY projects are good
- `r/HaveWeMet` where people all pretend to live in the same town
- `r/MapPorn` for interesting visualisations about the world
- `r/StopDoingScience` which encourages people to stop doing certain branches of science (my favourite meme format)
- `r/thaithai` for a community of Thai-speaking people
- `r/theocho` for weird sports from all around the world
- `r/UnsentLetters` to hear about things people wanted to say to someone but couldn't

To visit these subreddits, you can go to `www.reddit.com/r/{SUBREDDIT_NAME}`.
