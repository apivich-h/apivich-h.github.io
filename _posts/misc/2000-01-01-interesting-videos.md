I spend way too much time on YouTube. Here are some of my favourites from throughout the years.

## Science/Tech Videos

STEM videos.

- **[Computer Scientist Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGdb1CTu5c)** by _WIRED_. A video on zero-knowledge proofs. I also quite enjoy this series, since it slowly builds up the explanation of a single concept to different levels of diffculties.

- **[Hassium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQ8cZoA0tiU)** by _Periodic Videos_. It's a good series of video on the elements of the periodic table, but only one other person in the world will know a certain reference regarding this specific video on Hassium.

- **[i raced an AI to learn parkour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jt-erB_-3A)** by _Answer In Progress_. It kind of touches on reinforcement learning, and also discusses AI in more general terms as well.

- **[Which Planet is the Closest?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SumDHcnCRuU)** by _CGPGrey_. An interesting question that we rarely even consider.

- **[30 Weird Chess Algorithms: Elo World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpXy041BIlA)** by _suckerpinch_. Chess algorithms that I didn't know I even wanted to see implemented.

- **[Every PROOF you've seen that .999... = 1 is WRONG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMTD1Y3LHcE)** by _mCoding_.

- **[General Relativity Explained in 7 Levels of Difficulty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNhJY-R3Gwg)** by _minutephysics_.

## Videos about Thailand

Some videos that are about my home country that I approve of. I pick ones that are in English for the list.

- **[Pad Krapao: The Story Behind Thailand's Real National Dish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OupK3x8ujw)** by _OTR Food & History_. Real Thai food appreciators (and Thais like myself) will know that the _real_ national dish of Thailand is the Pad Krapao (stir-fried basil and rice) and not Pad Thai or whatever other dish they claim it to be. This video is a good one about this particular dish.

- **[Thai Election: Will the Military Launch a Coup?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fljhL-IxBJo)** by _TLDR News Global_. I am quite a fan of TLDR news, and this is one of the more relevant news to me. This is a video that summarises the results of the 2023 Thai election, which as of the video provides the reason why I am (cautiously) optimistic about Thailand's future.

- **[Why Thailand's Geography Breeds Instability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9SMRuvnl2g)** by _PolyMatter_. This time taking a look at how its geography relates to their politics.

- **[Nirvana for Sale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYm1EbNs4sU)** by _Unreported World_. I have been watching a number of documentaries from them, covering many interesting little-told stories around the world. In this piece, it focuses on arguably the most infamous temple in Thailand.

## Other Informative Videos

Videos that still teach you something.

- **Why Do I Choose To Do This For A Living** by _Jon Bois_. It is a video about poker by one of my favourite sports-related video creator. The original video is unfortunately taken down, but it might be possible to find a re-upload of it somewhere.

- **[Troy State 253, DeVry 141](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4afzQyGo5Q)** by _Jon Bois_. Another Jon Bois video I really like, with a good flow of the story.

- **[Why are British place names so hard to pronounce?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYNzqgU7na4)** by _Jay Foreman_.

- **[history of the entire world, i guess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuCn8ux2gbs)** by _Bill Wurtz_. He doesn't usually do these educational videos but I guess this qualifies as one.

- **[Music That Sounds Like The Lyrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMOMPMzR6oY)** by _David Bennett_. Good channel on music theory and music trivia.

## Music

Videos that are based on music.

- **[The Killers - Somebody Told Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdNYBvNXBLs)**. A legit link to the song with no memes whatsoever.

- **[Foo Fighters - Keep The Car Running](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDxcjukqISs)**. Just a solid cover of an Arcade Fire song.

- **[OK Computer but everything is my voice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q13NRoG6mvs)**. It's just a solid cover of an album.

- **[Paramore - Let The Flames Begin / Part II (Reading Festival 2014)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaM0BUWAm_4)**. Paramore playing a song followed by its sequel.

- **[Epic crowd singalong to Mr Brightside at Glastonbury 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzEs17iI2W4)**. The song that has been played live thousands of times, but still gets the crowd hyped every single time.

- **[Weezer - Pork and Beans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQHPYelqr0E)**. The song is okay, but the music video is essentially a great summary of 2010s internet culture.

- **[Through the Fire and the Flames on stepper motors V2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOaRFH_w53k)**.

- **[A piano performance of _Surrender_ by Birdy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzn97B5wMIQ)**. One of the best songs I've ever heard, performed beautifully on a piano.

- **[Never Gonna Give You Up, live at Glastonbury 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsCIeklgp1M)**. I'm just impressed Rick Astley is still going, and his voice being as good as ever.

## TV Shows and TV-Styles videos

These are series that probably could have been (or actually are) on traditional TV but is available to watch in its entirety on YouTube, or other videos that just has the TV feel.

- **[Taskmaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4YhsooE5xY&list=PLRWvNQVqAeWLpNL3IpUsGUdbaOiCG026u)** (the link starts at Series 1 Episode 1). The first 10 or so series are on YouTube, which is incredible. The premise is simple, but the execution is great.

- **[Starstruck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rA2CXNXD0g)**. A great comedy/romance series featuring the wonderful Rose Matafeo.

- **[Two Of These People Are Lying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlNNkeB9pjU&list=PLfx61sxf1Yz2I-c7eMRk9wBUUDCJkU7H0)** by _The Technical Difficulties_. A panel show-style series based around Wikipedia articles. For the record, Episode 2x03 is my favourite episode of the whole show.

- **[Video Game High School](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JqR3GVqib4&list=PLsMtUWKCmBPRFzqglpk4YQlNFy8wzSXBN)** by _Rocket Jump_. I don't think I would rewatch this show now (in a different stage of life now), but I did really enjoy it a bit when it came out.

- **[Madeline Gets Her Appendix Removed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo472Cpxhw8)**. You forgot this cartoon exist, didn't you? It's a very sweet cartoon - they don't make cartoons like these anymore.

- **[Breaking the News: Tom Scott and Matt Gray bonehead the budget](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2tYvANA8to)** by _Tom Scott_. Another Tom Scott classic.

## Vlog-like Videos

These are videos that are in a vlog style, featuring people living in or travelling to interesting places or times.

- **[Friends shocked to learn Princess Diana is dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0qMxFY29WA)**. A video taken in 1997 while the breaking news was on TV.

- **[Road Trip After Eight Years Without Driving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_naDg-guomA)** by _CGPGrey_. While Grey does do very good educational videos, the vlogs done in his style are also top notch. This is probably my favourite video that he has released.

- **[A Somewhat Normal Day At University of Alaska Fairbanks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzqBIGSF1ig)**. I am a fan of vlogs from random places, and this one is no different.

- **[Teaching in Whittier, Alaska...the state's one-building town](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naPguX84Amg)**. Can you tell I do want to go to Alaska?

## Funny Videos

These are funny videos.

- **[We Live In Singapura the MTV version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ch-z5s2JabY)**. The more I stay in Singapore, the more I understand the references made in this video.

- **[I once accidentally bought a horse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B94q7gUu75k)**. Probably the funniest bit from the show _Would I Lie To You?_.

- **[Nish Kumar Wants to be the Drummer From Coldplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsmuV7wLCl8)**.

- **[Can ANYONE name a single character from the movie Avatar?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxp1IBK1OPI)** by _Jacksfilms_.

- **[My Heart Will Go On - Recorder By Candlelight by Matt Mulholland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2WH8mHJnhM)**. The classic.

## Shorts

These are (mostly comedy) clips that are less than a minute long. I won't provide much description for these because for a lot of these it's better to go in with little context.

- **[When you walk into a pub and the cover band starts playing your song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCluHJ2uvnk)**.

- **[Maslow Pyramid Any% Speedrun - 8.1 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBCKZtpMSNE)**.

- **[I am the Danger but Walt forgets the line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUV8HSVe3nc)**. From what I understand this is actually from the show outtakes, and it is hilarious.

- **[When The Game Is Too Realistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KC4R6zIUb1c)**.

- **["Take one step on that rope and I'll cut it!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0t5krM8YeI)**.

- **[just a normal bowling alley screen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWW9-RDssn4)**.

- **[vamos dembélé!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptlX-5PkSx8)**. You need some football knowledge to get this one.

- **[Thom Yorke was raised in a barn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTlZsyas-eI)** by _Brian David Gilbert_.

- **[Well someone better be dying!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5pxwVSV1Ck)**. Great scene from Shrek the Third.

## Miscellaneous

Other videos that doesn't fit the categories above.

- **[Doraemon Final Ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB-wGxOFGkw)**. Fan-made ending, but still a good one nonetheless.

- **[Forest return to the Premier League](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cfrnTro94)**. Probably the biggest moment for Nottingham Forest since the turn of the century.

- **[The Greatest Shot In Television](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WoDQBhJCVQ)**.

- **[I spent a day with Ian Hecox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmws_bNRG6Q)** by _Anthony Padilla_. If you are aware of Smosh and their whole story of them between early/mid-2010s to around 2023(ish), then this video may be one you'd be anticipating for a good while. The interview talked a lot about their friendship, and I do think I got some interesting lessons and life outlooks out of it.
