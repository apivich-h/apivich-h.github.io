On this page, I have listed different projects that I have done either for my classes, as a research project or for fun. I will try to keep this page updated as I have more projects to present.

<!-- <br>

# Research Projects

At the moment, I have no published works. However, I will update this section when one is available. -->

<br>

# Senior Thesis

The title of my undergraduate thesis is **"Data Diversification in Different Domains"**. You can visit <a href="/projects/thesis">this page</a> for further details.

<br>

# Industry-Related Projects

I, with a few others, are working on projects with PTTEP, a Thai company who deals with extraction of petroleum. The projects I work on involves automation of tasks currently done by human, and will often require skills and knowledge from machine learning, statistics, mathematics and even physics. To make sure I do not break any non-disclosure agreements, I will not be describing the details of the projects here.

# Random Projects

I also have some random non-research, non-industry projects I did throughout my undergrad. See [here](/projects/old/).
