# Undergraduate Senior Thesis

The title of my undergraduate thesis is **"Data Diversification in Different Domains"**. You can visit <a href="/projects/thesis">this page</a> for further details.

# Industry-Related Projects

I, with a few others, are working on projects with PTTEP, a Thai company who deals with extraction of petroleum. The projects I work on involves automation of tasks currently done by human, and will often require skills and knowledge from machine learning, statistics, mathematics and even physics. To make sure I do not break any non-disclosure agreements, I will not be describing the details of the projects here.

# Random Projects

I also have some random non-research, non-industry projects I did throughout my undergrad. See [here](/projects/old/). -->
